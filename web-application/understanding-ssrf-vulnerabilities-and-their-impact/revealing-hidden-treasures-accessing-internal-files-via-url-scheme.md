# ðŸ˜‰ Revealing Hidden Treasures: Accessing Internal Files via URL Scheme

As our journey through the world of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) continues, we uncover a gallery of techniques that artists of exploitation employ to access concealed treasuresâ€”the internal files of web servers. These exploits, much like secret passages through a digital labyrinth, grant the attacker access to sensitive data or configurations.

### **The Intricate Exploits: Unlocking the Secrets**

Among the intriguing techniques within SSRF's palette, one noteworthy category involves accessing internal files through various URL schemes. This artistic endeavor allows attackers to explore the inner workings of the server and uncover hidden files. Let's examine some of these exquisite exploits:

* _The Eloquent File Scheme_: Our cyber artist begins with an eloquent exploit, crafting a URL that resonates with simplicity:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=file://etc/passwd
```

In this masterpiece, the attacker navigates the digital corridors to reach the `/etc/passwd` file, a treasure trove of user account information.

* _The Triple-Slash Marvel_: Like a virtuoso, the attacker adds complexity to their canvas with a URL adorned in triple slashes:

```perl
https://target.com/page?url=file:///etc/passwd
```

This marvel of an exploit weaves a path to the same `/etc/passwd` file, demonstrating the versatility of SSRF artistry.

* _The Unconventional Path_: In a display of creativity, the attacker employs unconventional slashes to obscure their intentions:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=file://\/\/etc/passwd
```

This unconventional path may baffle the uninitiated, but for the artist, it's a means to the same coveted `/etc/passwd` file.

* _The Path to Discovery_: With precision, the attacker uses the file scheme to reach specific files:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=file://path/to/file
```

Here, the canvas becomes a map, guiding the attacker to a file of interest, potentially unveiling hidden secrets within the server.

### **Conclusion: The Intricacies of SSRF Exploits**

As we conclude our exploration of SSRF exploits, we must emphasize the critical importance of security measures. These exploits, though fascinating, can have severe consequences for the security of web servers. Understanding SSRF vulnerabilities and the techniques used to exploit them is essential for protecting digital assets and ensuring that cyber artistry remains in the realm of ethical exploration.

# ðŸ¥« Exploring the Canvas: Common Exploits for Accessing Internal Pages

In our journey through the realm of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, we encounter a diverse array of exploits, each resembling a brushstroke on the canvas of cyber vulnerability. These exploits, like secret passageways into the heart of digital fortresses, hold the potential to access concealed treasures or wreak havoc within.

### **Accessing Forbidden Halls: The Art of Exploitation**

Among the arsenal of SSRF techniques, one intriguing path is the access to internal pagesâ€”an endeavor that opens doors to restricted realms. Here, we uncover some common exploits for accessing these forbidden halls:

* _The Admin Sanctum_: Imagine a digital fortress guarded by a labyrinthine URL. With a skillful stroke, the attacker crafts a URL like this:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1/admin
```

The attacker breaches the fortress walls, gaining entry into the coveted "admin" sanctum, where valuable secrets may be hidden.

* _The PHPMyAdmin Vault_: Another clandestine chamber beckonsâ€”the realm of PHPMyAdmin. The attacker's canvas is adorned with a URL like this:

```markdown
https://target.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin
```

Through this exploit, they navigate the digital corridors to reach the PHPMyAdmin vault, potentially exposing sensitive database information.

* _The PGAdmin Citadel_: Like an artist honing their craft, the attacker creates a URL masterpiece:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1/pgadmin
```

Here, the path leads to the PGAdmin citadel, where databases and configurations may lie vulnerable to prying eyes.

* _Uncharted Territories_: In their relentless pursuit of knowledge or chaos, the attacker may venture into uncharted territories with a URL like this:

```bash
https://target.com/page?url=http://127.0.0.1/any_interesting_page
```

This versatile exploit targets intriguing pages that defy classification, embracing the unpredictable nature of SSRF artistry.

### **Conclusion: The Artistry of SSRF Exploits**

As we conclude our creative exploration of SSRF attacks, we must remember that these exploits, while fascinating, have serious implications for cybersecurity. The ability to access internal pages highlights the importance of robust security measures to safeguard digital assets.

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, understanding SSRF vulnerabilities and the exploits used to breach them is essential. With this knowledge, defenders can fortify their defenses, ensuring that their digital canvases remain untouched by malicious brushstrokes.

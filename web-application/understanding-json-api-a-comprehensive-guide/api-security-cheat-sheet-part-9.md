81. **Negative Numbers as Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "-123",
     "password": "-456"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses negative numbers in string format, emphasizing the need for handling numeric values correctly.
82. **Values as URLs**

    ```json
    {"login": "https://admin.com",
     "password": "https://password.com"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Incorporates URLs as values, highlighting the importance of parsing and validating URL formats.
83. **Strings with Email Format**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin@admin.com",
     "password": "password@password.com"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features email addresses, underscoring the need for handling specific formats within string values.
84. **Strings with IP Address Format**

    ```json
    {"login": "192.0.2.0",
     "password": "203.0.113.0"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes IP address formats, stressing the importance of recognizing and validating various data formats.
85. **Strings with Date Format**

    ```json
    {"login": "2023-08-03",
     "password": "2023-08-04"}
    ```

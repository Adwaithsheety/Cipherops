# ðŸ§ž API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 7

61. **Credentials Containing Slashes**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin/user",
     "password": "pass/word"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features slashes, emphasizing the importance of handling special characters in credentials securely.
62. **Credentials Containing Multiple Data Types**

    ```json
    {"login": ["admin", 123, true, null, {"username": ["admin"]}],
     "password": ["password", 123, false, null, {"password": "password"}]}
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates a mix of different data types, highlighting the complexity of validating varied data structures.
63. **Using Escape Sequences**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin\\r\\n\\t",
     "password": "password\\r\\n\\t"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Incorporates escape sequences, underlining the need for correct processing of these characters.
64. **Using Curly Braces in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "{admin}",
     "password": "{password}"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes curly braces, stressing the importance of parsing and validating characters often used in data structures.
65. **Using Square Brackets in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "[admin]",
     "password": "[password]"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features square brackets, indicating the need to handle these characters appropriately in string values.
66. **Strings with Only Special Characters**

    ```json
    {"login": "!@#$$%^&*()",
     "password": "!@#$$%^&*()"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Contains only special characters, highlighting the importance of robust input validation and character handling.
67. **Strings with Control Characters**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin\b\f\n\r\t\v\0",
     "password": "password\b\f\n\r\t\v\0"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves control characters, underscoring the need for sanitizing inputs to prevent unintended effects.
68. **Null Characters in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin\0",
     "password": "password\0"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features null characters, pointing to the necessity of handling null bytes in string data.
69. **Exponential Numbers as Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "1e5",
     "password": "1e10"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses exponential notation, emphasizing the need for handling numeric formats in string fields.
70. **Hexadecimal Numbers as Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "0xabc",
     "password": "0x123"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates the use of hexadecimal values, highlighting the challenges in interpreting different numeric formats.

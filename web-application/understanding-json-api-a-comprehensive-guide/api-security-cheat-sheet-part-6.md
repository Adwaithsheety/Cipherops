# ðŸ§žâ™€ API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 6

51. **Backslashes in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "ad\\min",
     "password": "pa\\ssword"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates the use of backslashes, emphasizing the need for correct escape character handling.
52. **Long Strings of Special Characters**

    ```json
    {"login": "!@#$%^&*()"*1000,
     "password": "!@#$%^&*()"*1000}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features excessively long strings of special characters, pointing out the necessity for input length controls.
53. **Empty Key in JSON**

    ```json
    {"": "admin",
     "password": "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes an empty key, highlighting the importance of validating key names in JSON objects.
54. **JSON Injection in Key**

    ```json
    {"{\"injection\":\"value\"}": "admin",
     "password": "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Shows the potential for JSON injection within keys, underscoring the need for thorough validation of JSON keys.
55. **Quotation Marks in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "\"admin\"",
     "password": "\"password\""}
    ```

    _Description:_ Incorporates quotation marks, emphasizing the significance of parsing and validating such characters.
56. **Credentials as Nested Arrays**

    ```json
    {"login": [["admin"]],
     "password": [["password"]]}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features nested arrays, indicating the complexity of handling various data structures in authentication.
57. **Credentials as Nested Objects**

    ```json
    {"login": {"username": {"value": "admin"},
     "password": {"password": {"value": "password"}}}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes deeply nested objects, pointing to the challenges in parsing and validating multi-layered JSON structures.
58. **Keys as Numbers**

    ```json
    {123: "admin",
     456: "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses numeric keys, emphasizing the need for handling non-string keys in JSON objects.
59. **Testing with Greater Than and Less Than Signs**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin>1",
     "password": "<password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves comparison operators, highlighting the importance of sanitizing inputs to prevent logical errors or injections.
60. **Testing with Parentheses in Credentials**

    ```json
    {"login": "(admin)",
     "password": "(password)"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features parentheses, underscoring the need for handling special characters appropriately in authentication processes.

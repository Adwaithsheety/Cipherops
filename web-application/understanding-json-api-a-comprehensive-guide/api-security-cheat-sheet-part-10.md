# ðŸ§ž API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 10

91. **Strings with Backspace Characters**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin\b",
     "password": "password\b"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Incorporates backspace characters, highlighting the need for handling control characters that can alter string content.
92. **Test with Emoji in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "adminðŸ˜€",
     "password": "passwordðŸ˜€"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features emojis, emphasizing the importance of supporting a wide range of Unicode characters.
93. **JSON with Comments (Not Officially Supported)**

    ```json
    {/*"login": "admin",
     "password": "password"*/}
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates the use of comments, which are not officially supported in JSON, pointing to the need for strict JSON syntax adherence.
94. **JSON with Base64 Encoded Values**

    ```json
    {"login": "YWRtaW4=",
     "password": "cGFzc3dvcmQ="}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes Base64 encoding, stressing the importance of handling encoded data formats.
95. **Including Null Byte Character (May Cause Truncation)**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin\0",
     "password": "password\0"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Contains null byte characters, which can cause truncation in some systems, underscoring the need for careful handling of such characters.
96. **JSON with Credentials in Scientific Notation**

    ```json
    {"login": 1e100,
     "password": 1e100}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses scientific notation, highlighting the necessity to handle large numerical values correctly.
97. **Strings with Octal Values**

    ```json
    {"login": "\141\144\155\151\156",
     "password": "\160\141\163\163\167\157\162\144"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features octal values, indicating the challenges in interpreting different numeric representations.

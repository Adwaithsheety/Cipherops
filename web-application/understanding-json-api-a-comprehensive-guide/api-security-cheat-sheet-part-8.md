# üßû‚ôÇ API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 8

71. **Leading Zeros in Numeric Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "000123",
     "password": "000456"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves numeric strings with leading zeros, highlighting the need for handling numeric formats accurately in string fields.
72. **Multilingual Input (English and Korean)**

    ```json
    {"login": "adminÍ¥ÄÎ¶¨Ïûê",
     "password": "passwordÎπÑÎ∞ÄÎ≤àÌò∏"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Combines English and Korean characters, underscoring the importance of multilingual support and character encoding.
73. **Extremely Long Keys**

    ```json
    {"a"*10000: "admin",
     "b"*10000: "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates extraordinarily long keys, pointing to the need for handling and limiting key lengths in JSON objects.
74. **Extremely Long Unicode Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "\u0061"*10000,
     "password": "\u0062"*10000}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features excessively long Unicode strings, emphasizing the necessity of input length control and proper Unicode handling.
75. **JSON Strings with Semicolon**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin;",
     "password": "password;"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes semicolons, stressing the importance of correctly parsing and validating such characters.
76. **JSON Strings with Backticks**

    ```json
    {"login": "`admin`",
     "password": "`password`"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Contains backticks, indicating the need for proper handling of alternative quotation marks.
77. **JSON Strings with Plus Sign**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin+",
     "password": "password+"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features plus signs, highlighting the significance of correctly interpreting and handling special characters.
78. **JSON Strings with Equal Sign**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin=",

# ðŸ§žâ™‚ API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 1

Ensuring robust security in API (Application Programming Interface) interactions is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and systems. Below is a comprehensive cheat sheet detailing various authentication scenarios and their implications for API security.

1.  **Basic Credentials Authentication**

    ```json
    {
      "login": "admin",
      "password": "admin"
    }
    ```

    Description: Utilizes standard username and password combination. Requires strong password policies to ensure security.
2.  **Empty Credentials Authentication**

    ```json
    {
      "login": "",
      "password": ""
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Represents cases where credentials are left empty. Such scenarios should be handled to prevent unauthorized access.
3.  **Null Values in Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": null,
      "password": null
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves null values in credentials, highlighting the need for robust input validation in authentication systems.
4.  **Numeric Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": 123,
      "password": 456
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Showcases the use of numbers as credentials, emphasizing the importance of diverse data type handling in security protocols.
5.  **Boolean-Based Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": true,
      "password": false
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Unconventional use of boolean values in credentials, posing unique challenges in authentication logic.
6.  **Array-Type Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": ["admin"],
      "password": ["password"]
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Demonstrates credentials embedded in arrays, requiring APIs to handle various data structures securely.
7.  **Object-Based Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": {"username": "admin"},
      "password": {"password": "password"}
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes nested objects for credentials, highlighting the complexity in parsing and validating nested data.
8.  **Special Characters in Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": "@dm!n",
      "password": "p@ssw0rd#"
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves special characters, underscoring the need for handling diverse character sets in security measures.
9.  **SQL Injection Attempt**

    ```json
    {
      "login": "admin' --",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Represents a SQL injection attack, emphasizing the critical need for input sanitization in API security.
10. **HTML Tags in Credentials**

    ```json
    {
      "login": "<h1>admin</h1>",
      "password": "ololo-HTML-XSS"
    }
    ```

    _Description:_ Showcases an attempt to inject HTML, pointing to the necessity of guarding against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

***

This cheat sheet provides a snapshot of various authentication scenarios that API developers and security professionals should consider when designing and securing APIs. Each scenario underlines specific security considerations, ranging from input validation, handling of different data types, to the prevention of common injection attacks.

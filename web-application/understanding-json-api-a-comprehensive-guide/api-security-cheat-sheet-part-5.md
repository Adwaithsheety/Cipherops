# üßû‚ôÇ API Security Cheat Sheet PART - 5

41. **Tab Characters in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "ad\tmin",
     "password": "pa\tssword"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Incorporates tab characters, demonstrating the need to handle or sanitize special character sequences.
42. **Test with HTML Content in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "<b>admin",
     "password": "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses HTML tags, underscoring the importance of protecting against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and similar attacks.
43. **JSON Injection in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "{\"injection\":\"value\"}",
     "password": "password"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Shows the possibility of JSON injection, highlighting the need for careful parsing and validation of JSON strings.
44. **Test with XML Content in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin",
     "password": "<xml>password</xml>"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes XML tags in strings, pointing to the necessity of handling different data formats securely.
45. **Combination of Number, Strings, and Special Characters**

    ```json
    {"login": "ad123min!@",
     "password": "pa55w0rd!@"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features a mix of alphanumeric and special characters, emphasizing the need for robust character handling.
46. **Floating Numbers as Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "123.456",
     "password": "789.123"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Uses floating-point numbers as strings, stressing the importance of versatile data type interpretation.
47. **Value as a Combination of Languages**

    ```json
    {"login": "admin‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡§ï",
     "password": "password‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§°"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Combines English and Hindi characters, showcasing the challenge of multilingual data handling.
48. **Non-ASCII Characters in Strings**

    ```json
    {"login": "‚àÜadmin‚àÜ",
     "password": "‚àÜpassword‚àÜ"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Involves non-ASCII characters, illustrating the need for international character set support.
49. **Single Character Keys and Values**

    ```json
    {"l": "a",
     "p": "p"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Utilizes single-character keys and values, demonstrating the necessity to handle minimalistic JSON structures.
50. **Use of Environment Variables**

    ```json
    {"login": "${USER}",
     "password": "${PASS}"}
    ```

    _Description:_ Features environment variables as values, indicating the need for careful evaluation of variable substitution in credentials.

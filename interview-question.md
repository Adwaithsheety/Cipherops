# VAPT Interview Questions
- What do you mean by security testing?
   Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.
- What do you mean by vulnerability?
   Vulnerability is the inability to resist a hazard or to respond when a disaster has occurred. 
- What do you mean by penetration testing?
   A penetration test (pen test) is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.
- What are the two prevalent techniques used to safeguard a password file?
- What are the major attributes of security testing?
   Normally, security testing has the following attributes:
 👉 Authentication.
 👉 Authorization.
 👉 Confidentiality.
 👉 Availability.
 👉 Integrity.
 👉 Non-repudiation.
- What is the importance of VAPT?
  VAPT helps to protect your organisation by providing visibility of security weaknesses and guidance to address them.
- As a developer, what will you do to rectify existing cross-site scripting vulnerability in the code that the application security auditors have reported?
- What do you know about WSDL and SOAP?
 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a message protocol that enables the distributed elements of an application to communicate. SOAP can be carried over a variety   of standard protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## DevOps Interview Questions

- What do you know about DevOps?
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high            velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
- What is the role of AWS in DevOps?
  AWS provides services that help you practice DevOps at your company and that are built first for use with AWS. These tools automate manual tasks, help teams manage      complex environments at scale, and keep engineers in control of the high velocity that is enabled by DevOps.
- How is DevOps different from agile methodology?
   DevOps is a culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. Agile can be described as a             development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.
- What are the different phases in DevOps?
 DevOps follows certain processes that include code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor and plan. DevOps lifecycle follows various phases such as   continuous development, integration, testing, continuous monitoring, and continuous feedback.
- How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?
- What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
  Continuous Delivery (CD): CI + the entire software release process is automated, it may be composed of multiple stages, and deployment to production is manual.         Continuous Deployment: CI + CD + fully automated deployment to production.
- What is the role of configuration management in DevOps?
  Configuration management is important because it enables the ability to scale infrastructure and software systems without having to correspondingly scale                 administrative staff to manage those systems. This can make it possible to scale where it previously wasn't feasible to do so.
- What are the fundamental differences between DevOps & Agile?

# Cyber security analyst
- What is the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption?
 Symmetric encryption uses a single key that needs to be shared among the people who need to receive the message while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public key  and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating
- What is the difference between IDS and IPS?
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is defined as a solution that monitors network events and analyzes them to detect security incidents and imminent threats. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is defined as a solution that performs intrusion detection and then goes one step ahead and prevents any detected threats.
- What are the response codes that can be received from a Web Application?
- What steps will you take to secure a server?
Server Security in 3 Steps
Step 1 – Shut Down Access. As IT admins install appropriate software packages and applications onto servers, invariably ports are opened and services enabled. ...
Step 2 – Patch Your Servers. ...
Step 3 – Tightly Control User Access.
  
- How can identity theft be prevented?
One of the most effective ways to protect against identity theft is to monitor your credit reports and billing statements so you can spot and report unauthorized activity
- How would you reset a password-protected BIOS configuration?
- How often should you perform Patch management?
- What are salted hashes?
Salting hashes sounds like one of the steps of a hash browns recipe, but in cryptography, the expression refers to adding random data to the input of a hash function to guarantee a unique output, the hash, even when the inputs are the same

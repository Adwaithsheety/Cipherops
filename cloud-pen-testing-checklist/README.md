From sneaky subdomain scans to extracting hidden email addresses, this checklist has it all. It even teaches you how to use Google Dorking to find juicy information and gather breached credentials like a digital detective.

But it doesn't stop there. With CLI tools like Az PowerShell, you can unleash your hacking skills on virtual machines, storage buckets, and network components. It's like having a master key to the cloud kingdom.

And if you need extra firepower, there are special tools like GitLeaks, Mimikatz, and PowerView to uncover hidden secrets. You can even create your vulnerable infrastructure with projects like Cloudgoat and SadCloud to test your skills to the limit.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Always use your skills ethically and stay on the right side of the digital law.

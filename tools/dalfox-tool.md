# üï∂ DalFox Tool

**Key Features of DalFox**

DalFox offers a variety of modes and features that cater to different aspects of XSS scanning:

1. **Modes of Operation**: DalFox operates in different modes such as `url`, `sxss`, `pipe`, `file`, `server`, and `payload` for varied scanning requirements.
2. **Discovery and Analysis**: It conducts thorough parameter analysis to find reflected parameters, alive or bad special characters, event handlers, and attack code. DalFox identifies injection points in HTML, JS, and Attributes.
3. **Static and BAV Analysis**: The tool performs static analysis by checking headers like CSP and XFO. It also tests for Basic Another Vulnerability (BAV), including SQL injection, SSTI, open redirects, CRLF, and ESII.
4. **Parameter Mining and Built-in Grepping**: DalFox finds new parameters using a dictionary attack or DOM and identifies basic information leaks like SSTI, Credential errors, SQL errors, etc.
5. **WAF Detection and Evasion**: It detects Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and can evade them using slow requests.
6. **Comprehensive XSS Scanning**: DalFox is capable of reflected XSS, stored XSS, and DOM XSS scanning, including headless and blind XSS testing.
7. **Friendly Pipeline and Payload Optimization**: Supports various input methods and optimizes query payloads based on the identified injection points.
8. **Extensive HTTP Options and Encoder**: Offers numerous HTTP options like method overwriting, redirects, headers, cookies, and user-agent settings. It also provides encoders for double URL and HTML Hex.
9. **Output and Reporting**: DalFox provides concise output with PoC codes and offers detailed reporting in plain or JSON formats„Äê45‚Ä†source„Äë.

**Real-World Usage Examples**
